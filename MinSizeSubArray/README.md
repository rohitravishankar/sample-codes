###Minimum Size Subarray Sum

Given an array of **n** positive integers and a positive integer **s**, find the minimal length of a **contiguous** subarray of which the sum â‰¥ **s**. If there isn't one, return `0` instead.

For example, given the array `[2,3,1,2,4,3]` and `s = 7`,
the subarray `[4,3]` has the minimal length under the problem constraint.

####Input Format

1. Number of elements in the array
2. All the elements in thea array
3. The sum for which minimum subset is to be found

####Output Format

The length of the subset
